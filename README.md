# RKM

Here we try to implement all of the language specified in the main branch but with mostly syntactic changes:
*  Whitespace occasionally matters, which will allow fewer `;` and `{...}`s. (inspired by all these new whitespace-significant languages, and, of course, they are still allowed)
*  Much less restrictions on operators.
